# Kartik Hulmukh
### Secure Backend & Distributed Systems Engineer

I design and build secure, transaction-safe backend systems for FinTech, crypto, and high-risk applications where correctness and encryption are non-negotiable.

My work focuses on backend architecture, distributed networking, and financial-grade system integrity.

## Core Expertise

- Secure Backend Architecture (Node.js, Django, Express)
- Transaction-Safe Financial Systems (Ledger Design, Idempotency, WAL Concepts)
- End-to-End Encryption (X3DH, Double Ratchet, Ed25519)
- Distributed Networking & Real-Time Systems (WebRTC, Peer-to-Peer)
- API Security (JWT, OAuth, RBAC, Access Control)
- Database Architecture (MongoDB, Schema Validation, Consistency Design)
- System Scalability & Failure Handling

## Selected Engineering Work

### 🔐 Distributed Encrypted Networking System
Production-grade peer discovery and encrypted multi-hop routing system.

- Implemented X3DH key exchange and Double Ratchet protocol
- Designed secure identity and session management
- Built P2P communication layer with NAT traversal
- Hardened cryptographic operations and memory handling

---

### 💳 Transaction-Safe Ledger Backend
Financial backend system designed to maintain atomic transaction correctness.

- Idempotent transaction flow to prevent double execution
- WAL-inspired recovery architecture
- Data consistency validation at schema and logic level
- Built for high integrity under concurrent load

---

### ⚡ Secure REST API Architecture
Scalable backend infrastructure for modern web applications.

- Modular Express / Django backend structure
- JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization
- Middleware-based security enforcement
- Structured error handling & request validation

---

### 🌐 High-Performance Full-Stack Application
Production-ready MERN/Next.js application with optimized backend logic.

- Scalable MongoDB schema design
- Efficient API response optimization
- Secure authentication & session handling
- Clean frontend-backend separation

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- Security is architecture, not an afterthought.
- Financial systems must guarantee correctness under failure.
- Simplicity scales better than clever complexity.
- Predictable systems outperform fragile optimizations.
